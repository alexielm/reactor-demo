This "reactor-demo" is an application to showcase the "reactor" function.

"reactor" is a very small framework that helps keep components up to date with the changes done on a global data set they regester to.
The components registered to this global data set will be automatically scheduled to render as soon as a value used on the component is changed.

This repository contains the reactor code on the "src/framework/reactor.js" file
