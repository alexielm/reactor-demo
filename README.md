"reactor" is a very small framework that helps keep components up to date with the changes dones on a central data set they utilize.
The components connected to this central data set will be automatically scheduled to render as soon as any of the values used on the component is changed anywhere on the application.

This repository contains the reactor code on the "src/framework/reactor.js" file

This "reactor-demo" is application to showcase the "reactor" function.
