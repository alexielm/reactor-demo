This **reactor-demo** is an application to showcase the **reactor**.

**reactor** is a very small entity that helps keep components up to date with the changes done on a global data set they regester to.
The components registered to this global data set will be automatically scheduled to render as soon as a value used on the component is changed.

This repository contains the reactor code on the *src/framework/reactor.js* file
